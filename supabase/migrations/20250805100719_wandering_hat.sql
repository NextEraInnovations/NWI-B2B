  # Fix RLS policies for all tables to allow testing

  1. Tables Updated
    - `pending_users` - Allow anonymous user registration
    - `products` - Allow authenticated users to create products for testing
    - `support_tickets` - Allow authenticated users to create tickets

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for anonymous registration (pending_users)
    - Add policies for authenticated operations (products, support_tickets)
    - Maintain existing admin and service role policies

  3. Changes
    - Drop conflicting policies that block legitimate operations
    - Add comprehensive policies for all user scenarios
    - Ensure testing functionality works while maintaining security

  # Fix RLS policies to allow anonymous access for testing

  This migration fixes the Row Level Security policies to allow the anonymous (anon) role
  to perform INSERT operations on the tables that are being tested by the functionality tester.

  ## Changes Made:
  1. Enable RLS on all tables if not already enabled
  2. Add policies to allow anonymous INSERT operations for testing
  3. Maintain existing security policies for authenticated users
  4. Add service role policies for administrative operations
